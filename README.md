Learning points 
CSS : 
1. changing the display from none to flex/block - this allows for pop ups to work 
2. box-shadow - offset-x offset-y blur-radius color
3. rgba - normal rgb + alpha which means the transparency 
4. transform - this changes the various characteristics of an element without affecting the layout. here the general translateY is used to move it in Y direction to give that 3d movement effect
5. z-index - this is predominantly used with fixed position which allows for overlapping of elements
 
HTML :
1. data-id - these are custom ids which can be changed accordingly and also accessed by the js code 

JS : 
1. trim() - removes excess blank space
2. .replace() 
3. appendChild()
4. .dataset.id
